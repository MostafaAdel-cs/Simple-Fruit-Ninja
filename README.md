Before playing our game, There are some tips you have to know:

We currently support classic mode only.
You shouldn't press the mouse while slicing the fruits,
You slice the fruits or bombs by just moving the mouse over it.

Report includes detailed instructions on how to play.

Highscore is saved in a file, so we read it whenever we need.

We applied cool music and sound effects when you slice or miss fruits.

The project wasn't complicated too much and we enjoyed working on it.
We all worked on everything in the project so its hard to say how we split it,
But most of the time we shared our laptop screens and worked together.
We used GITLAB to share our changes.

Thank you for taking time to read and I hope you enjoy our simple game :)
